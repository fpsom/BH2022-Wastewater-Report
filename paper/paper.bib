	abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater-based epidemiology has progressively taken a central role as a pathogen surveillance tool. Tracking viral loads and variant outbreaks in sewage offers advantages over clinical surveillance methods by providing unbiased estimates and enabling early detection. However, wastewater-based epidemiology poses new computational research questions that need to be solved in order for this approach to be implemented broadly and successfully. Here, we address the variant deconvolution problem, where we aim to estimate the relative abundances of genomic variants from next-generation sequencing data of a mixed wastewater sample. We introduce LolliPop, a computational method to solve the variant deconvolution problem by simultaneously solving least squares problems and kernel-based smoothing of relative variant abundances from wastewater time series sequencing data. We derive multiple approaches to compute confidence bands, and demonstrate the application of our method to data from the Swiss wastewater surveillance efforts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementPart of this study was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant No. CRSII5_205933).

	abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater-based epidemiology has progressively taken a central role as a pathogen surveillance tool. Tracking viral loads and variant outbreaks in sewage offers advantages over clinical surveillance methods by providing unbiased estimates and enabling early detection. However, wastewater-based epidemiology poses new computational research questions that need to be solved in order for this approach to be implemented broadly and successfully. Here, we address the variant deconvolution problem, where we aim to estimate the relative abundances of genomic variants from next-generation sequencing data of a mixed wastewater sample. We introduce LolliPop, a computational method to solve the variant deconvolution problem by simultaneously solving least squares problems and kernel-based smoothing of relative variant abundances from wastewater time series sequencing data. We derive multiple approaches to compute confidence bands, and demonstrate the application of our method to data from the Swiss wastewater surveillance efforts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementPart of this study was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant No. CRSII5_205933).

Here, we present V-pipe 3.0, a computational pipeline designed for analyzing next-generation sequencing data of short viral genomes. It is developed to enable reproducible, scalable, adaptable, and transparent inference of genetic diversity of viral samples. By presenting two large-scale data analysis projects, we demonstrate the effectiveness of V-pipe 3.0 in supporting sustainable viral genomic data science.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

TITLE = {Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA Fragments in Wastewater Detects the Spread of New Variants during Major Events},

ABSTRACT = {The sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater is an unbiased method to detect the spread of emerging variants and to track regional infection dynamics, which is especially useful in case of limited testing and clinical sequencing. To test how major international events influence the spread of new variants we have sequenced SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater samples of Davos, Landquart, Lostallo, and St. Moritz in the Swiss canton of Grisons in the time around the international sports competitions in Davos and St. Moritz in December 2021, and additionally in May 2022 and January 2023 in Davos and St. Moritz during the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. The prevalence of the variants identified from the wastewater sequencing data showed that the Omicron variant BA.1 had spread in Davos and St. Moritz during the international sporting events hosted there in December 2021. This spread was associated with an increase in case numbers, while it was not observed in Landquart and Lostallo. Another instance of new variant spread occurred during the WEF in January 2023, when the Omicron variant BA.2.75 arrived in Davos but not in St. Moritz. We can therefore conclude that major international events promote the spread of new variants in the respective host region, which has important implications for the protective measures that should be taken.},
